# This is where you put info about your addons.
#
# Addons are just modules that extend the StraightServer::Server module.
# 
# Addon modules can be both rubygems or files under ~/.straight/addons/.
# If ~/.straight/addons.yml contains a 'path' key for a particular addon, then it means
# the addon is placed under the ~/.straight/addons/. If not, it is assumed it is
# already in the LOAD_PATH somehow, with rubygems for example.
#
#
# Example:
#
#   payment_ui:               # <- name doesn't affect anything, just shows up in the log file
#     path: addons/payment_ui # <- This is unnecessary if addon is already in the LOAD_PATH
#     module: PaymentUI       # <- actual module should be a submodule of StraightServer::Addon
